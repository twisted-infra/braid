Brain-dump:

- DONE Figure out how to handle config, with split-repos

  Perhaps this is just `~/.fabricrc` or maybe we want a `~/.braidrc` instead.
  Or maybe we don't actually need a config file. We just point things at dornkirk,
  and override on the command file.

- ssh
  - DONE Initialize /etc/ssh/sshd_config to use 'Match Group service' for authorized keys.

  - DONE Also figure out where we should put keys, and add some tools for updating them.

  - DONE The latter perhaps wants to use something like launchpadadduser.

- Also, how do ~/start scripts then invoke twistd? This is the part of the fancy
  initscript wrapper that seems the most useful. But I think it only needs to be
  a couple of lines. (Or maybe a few more, but clearer lines of
  twisted.python.usage.)

- Implemente other services.

- DONE The setup of the base image should probably be a seperate command, rather than
  automatically being called by each service. This includes stuff like python, pypy
  gcc (for 'pip install twisted'), git, bzr.

- Do we want to verify that stuff is installed, before doing the service install then?

- DONE Adding and maintaining crontab entries.

- DONE Add 'log' targets to services for tailing (or less +F-ing?) log files.

- Something that would be nice for testing is the ability to specify a
  non-default repo for update commands. I'd like to be able to test against a
  commit in a local repo, without having to push to a public repo first.

- Coding-style fixes
  - docstings
  - camelCase
  - Other fabric/braid specific style guidelines?


Future stuff:
- Automatic maintence log generation?
- Alternate handling of ssh-keys not using 'Match Group'?
  - Perhaps useful for buildslaves.
